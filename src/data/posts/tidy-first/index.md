This book puts names to some of the coding habits I've grown to use over the years: I used them, just didn't name them.

I'm not talking about guard clauses or dead code (those are almost universal now), but reading order, cohesion order and so on, I find very refreshing to see that these are some common patterns.

What really surprised me though, was seeing optionality discussed in the context of code.

The previous book I read, was all about options, it was almost serendipity to see the topic discussed here.

I still have to wrap my head around it, but I think I start to see a light at the end of that specific tunnel.

The whole idea of tidying, and whether to do it first or later, is presented in a straightforward way and the author gives pointers about the pros/cons of these and similar approaches.

More books are on the way, looking forward to them.

### Excerpt

> Make the code tidier for the next person. If everyone follows the Scout rule (“leave it better than you found it”), the code will become more livable-with over time
