Hi 👋, I'm Juan B., currently residing in Panama City 🌴

I'm a software engineer, mostly focused on React Native, but ❤️ coding in general.

I'm the author of [ControlR](https://www.apertoire.com/controlr), an app to manage Unraid servers.

Welcome to my site, where I post about tech, software, books and other random stuff.
