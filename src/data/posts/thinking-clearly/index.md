The Art of Thinking Clearly

Found this to be a compilation/rehashing of concepts and examples originally found on "The Black Swan", "Antifragile" by Nicholas Nassim Taleb, "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman and some bits of "Predictably Irrational" by Dan Ariely, which are frequently cited in this book.

So maybe, if you want a summary of those books, pick this one up, if you want the real deal, skip it

No excerpt.
