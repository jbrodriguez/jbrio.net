## Introduction

I used to post content at different sites:

- blog.jbrio.net
- pardenotas.jbrio.net
- jbrio.net

From now on, everything will be centralized at [jbrio.net](https://jbrio.net).

## Why ?

In light of everything that's going on in twitterland, I've decided that the best way forward is to own my content.

I will control what I post, and where I post it.

I also created a [mastodon](https://mas.to/@jbrodriguez) account, and will be posting there as well.
