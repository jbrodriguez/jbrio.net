I had to speed past the last 3 chapters.

Yes, there were some nice tidbits about insider trading (but 100 years ago which are not relevant anymore), about tough times at some major companies, but it felt too long, too convoluted, too many repetitions.

Not getting this book may also be the reason why i'm not a billionaire like Bill Gates, but ...

I don't have an excerpt.
