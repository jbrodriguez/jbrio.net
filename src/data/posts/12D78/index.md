so, it's been quite a while now since my last update with regards to my hackintosh, old trusted blackbeard.

i have to tell you ... it's killing me the fact that sleep isnt working ... whenever i shutdown and come online again, i have to rearrange most of the windows in their corresponding workspace (i have 6 workspaces).

but that's _literally_ NOTHING compared to the fact that the whole system freezes, due to some god forsaken nvidia drivers for my gtx 660ti ... no incantation i tried made any difference ... and there are plenty of reports about this even on the official apple support forums (with regards to macbook pros and such).

On March 14, 2013, Apple released 10.8.3 ... i'm expecting a lot from this update (since beta testers/developers were asked to specifically look for graphics upgrades).

i hope my freeze problems are a thing of the past.

i'm also trying to help a little with regards to the sleeping issue, by upgrading my system definition to macpro 5,1 ... supposedly 5,1 handles sleeping better than 3,1.

on the other hand, i was reading in zite today that 10.8.3 fixed some sleeping issues in macbook pro retinas !!! wtff !!!! (what the flying f... !!!)

so i have to assume the following scenarios will eventually take place:

- upgrading to 10.8.3 fixes the nvidia driver issues. all is good
- upgrading to 10.8.3 doesn't fix sheet, so i'm back to square one
- driver fixed, i have to fix sleep issues ... there are several alternatives to look into for the sleeping issue: applehpa.kext ... kill it !

all things considered, blackbeard is so awesome !
