The end of the book took me by surprise, as it seemed there was more story to tell.

This book tells about how the major ai players today were born, doing a semi-biography of some of the main characters, but i felt it lacked essence

The biggest takeaways for me are :

- Will AI become sentient:

  Some say it will, some say it won't, it's a probability game at the moment, but everyone in the know is full on alert

- AI is very biased

  Stereotypes are propagated since AI are a function of their input, which is also predominantly biased
