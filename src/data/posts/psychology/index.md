It brings some good points about what being rich, being wealthy means to different people

As human, we have different driving factors, some are never satisfied with what they have, even when extremely rich, others are satisfied with paying a house in cash

The most important takeaway for me is that wealth is hidden

### Excerpt

“But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now.”
