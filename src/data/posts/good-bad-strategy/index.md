### Takeaways

what clicked for me is that a good strategy is something that is backed by concrete actions on how to achieve goals.

it's not good to just say, i want to have 1 billion customers in 5 years, without having actual, concrete actions that will get you there.

### Other notes

sometimes the book feels to me like self promotion, the author tends to publicize how he knew/deducted/pushed people to some conclusion, which is not bad at all, just a bit annoying.

### Excerpt

> Good strategy is coherent action backed up by an argument, an effective mixture of thought and action with a basic underlying structure I call the kernel
