This is a gem of a book, making you aware of the implications of good/bad sleeping.

We always hear our doctor tell us ... you need to get sleep, try to sleep better, it's good for your health, etc.

This book goes deep into why that's the case, with studies, examples, in a very scientific, methodic approach.

Grab a copy and read it !
