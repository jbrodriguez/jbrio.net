My genius type based on this book's definition was pretty spot on, can't tell if the same happens for other types, but it seems like it does.

The other interesting concept is regarding streams of wealth and money flowing around and how you should seek to latch onto them, for some genius types, it means asking how can you help someone make money, and yourself make money in the process

I also liked how it debunked some "well know paths to success", such as passive income, there has never been such a thing, every investments needs active management, maybe some to a lesser degree than others, but still need it.

### Excerpt

“You can be on the field, passing and ready to kick the ball. But if there are no team players on the field with you, you will be waiting a long time for that ball to come back. Connections are about knowing that flow grows the more you are connected to others playing the same game as you the right way.”
